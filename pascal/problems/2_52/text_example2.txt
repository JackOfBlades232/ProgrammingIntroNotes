WE FOUND HELL IN A BEAUTIFUL NEIGHBORHOOD. IN 1981, WILLIAMSVILLE
offered the tastiest real estate in Buffalo, New York. Leafy and friendly, its
safe streets were dotted with dainty homes filled with model citizens.
Doctors, attorneys, steel plant executives, dentists, and professional football
players lived there with their adoring wives and their 2.2 kids. Cars were
new, roads swept, possibilities endless. We’re talking about a living,
breathing American Dream. Hell was a corner lot on Paradise Road.
That’s where we lived in a two-story, four-bedroom, white wooden home
with four square pillars framing a front porch that led to the widest,
greenest lawn in Williamsville. We had a vegetable garden out back and a
two-car garage stocked with a 1962 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud, a 1980
Mercedes 450 SLC, and, in the driveway, a sparkling new 1981 black
Corvette. Everyone on Paradise Road lived near the top of the food chain,
and based on appearances, most of our neighbors thought that we, the socalled happy, well-adjusted Goggins family, were the tip of that spear. But
glossy surfaces reflect much more than they reveal.
