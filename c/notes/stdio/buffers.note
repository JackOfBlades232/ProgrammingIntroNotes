All input-output works like this: a buffer is created (for stdio -- on c lib
level), and each time one reaches for a value, the buffer is filled up, and 
then we can getchar() one int from the buffer, thus saving us precious syscalls

With output you also write to buffer, and when certin conditions are met, it is
flushed to the destination.

Buffers are flushed when full, when program terminated correctly. If working
with terminal, also flushed when \n or when encountering input.
